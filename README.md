### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yalcin Selcuk <br />
I am a 3rd year computer engineering student at Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ University. <br />
I am interested in Java and C#. <br /> 
I have Web Backend studies with Java. <br />
I just started working with C# and I want to get advanced in it as soon as possible. <br /> <br />
