### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yalcin Selcuk
I am a 3rd year computer engineering student at Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ University.
I am interested in Java and C#.
I have Web Backend studies with Java.
I just started working with C# and I want to get advanced in it as soon as possible.

Below you will find the links of a few projects I have worked on Java;
